Web API Test Client

This was initially in C#.  I converted the source project from, https://github.com/yaohuang/WebApiTestClient.

A simple Test Client built on top of ASP.NET Web API Help Page.

Get it on NuGet.org
Install-Package WebApiTestClient.VB

I eventually want to swap out jquery-ui for bootstrap.
